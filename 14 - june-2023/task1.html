     <p>We can save birds by doing little
         things like providing a source of water 
         for them to drink. Further, we can elevate 
         bird feeders and plant native plants and trees
          for them. Similarly, we can put up birdhouses 
          and garden organically so 
        that birds can feed on insects and worms.ehrbrthrth</p>
